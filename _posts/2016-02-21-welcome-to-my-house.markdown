###Hello friendly user!

Welcome to my site! I am still pretty new to [Jekyll](http://Jekyll.com) and everything you see here is currently under construction.

In the near future, you can expect to see blog post about my thoughts as an undergrad,
hacker, CS major, and friendly neighbor. I hope I can make a post at least 1 week but
nothing is tentative yet.

Thanks for dropping by! Click on my links at the [home]({{site.url}}) page to contact me if you want.

Adi√≥s!
