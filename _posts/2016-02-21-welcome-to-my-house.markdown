###Hello friendly user!

Welcome to my site! I am still pretty new to [Jekyll](http://Jekyll.com) and everything you see here is currently under construction.

In the near future, you can expect to see blog post about my thoughts as an undergrad,
hacker, CS major, and friendly neighbor. I hope I can make a post at least 1 week but
nothing is tentative yet.

Thanks for dropping by! Click on my links at the [home]({{site.url}}) page to contact me if you want.

AdiÃ³s!

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
