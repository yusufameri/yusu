### Note to others:
The following is a note I am writing/wrote to myself to reflect back on in times of (dis)stress. They are not meant to be targeted towards a general audience but if you find value in the message and it resonates with you, by all means feel free to bookmark this page and/or share with a friend in need.

Your Friend,  
Yusuf

### Why this exists

Whenever I am feeling down or feel that I have no control or "out" in a situation in my life, I need to remind myself of the times and mindset I had that got me out of where I was. It seems to happen seasonally (although I am young, and have not experienced many seasons) and can creep onto me without my noticing. Nevertheless, here is what you, Yusuf, should know and understand if you are feeling lost at this time of your life.

# (start here) For when you're feeling down...
You will persevere. Read that again.

You will persevere.

You will persevere.


**You.**  
**Will.**  
**Persevere.**


Whatever you are feeling right now is temporary and it will not last forever. I know it can feel like you are in a helpless situation or the failure you are about to experience (or have experienced) will put you in a trajectory that is not recoverable. This is not true. This has never been true. The pain you are experiencing is tough. It sucks. It’s real. Believe me, I know. But it's temporary. The higher the level of pain you are feeling, the shorter time it will likely last, especially if this situation came out of (seemingly) nowhere and you know this situation is unique.

# What you should be doing right now

Stand up. Stretch. Power pose. Take a walk. Find a friend or someone you can trust and get on the phone or talk with them. You will feel 10x better. Did you do that, or are you still reading? Okay, you are still here. Breathe deeply. In-and-out for 5 mins… 

1...  
2......  
3.........  
4............  
5............... 

Take a 1 hour nap.   
A short sleep and reset will help immensely.
  
If the situation must be resolved right now, empty your mind, free your thoughts or fears of failure. Thinking about failure cannot bring success right now, so stop thinking about it. Think about what needs to be done at this moment, then do it.

## Retrospective
**The deed is done, and you can reflect back.**  
*Only read this after the situation, not during it...*

Okay. So, the hardest day was before us. Or a hard day just passed. Now we can look back and reflect on what just happened or what is happening. I won't make any assumptions but ask that you ask yourself these questions.

* What led to this situation happening?
* Was anything in your control during the situation?
* Was anything outside of your control during the situation?
* Was there anything or any pattern of behavior in the weeks or months prior that led to this state of mind or situation?
* Did you ignore something continuously or did you honestly not see anything coming?

Only you can be honest with yourself about how you got here. Other people can be soft on you and give you excuses for why what happened, happened, but only you can be tough on yourself and know why you are the way you are. 

Are you going to let this happen **again**? Are you going to have the same mindset **again?** Are you going to forgive yourself, easily **again**? Are you going to ignore the faults that led to this **again** -- or are you going to say: "this was the **last** time." ***Never*** **again**. 

My mindset can change, but I must know that my actions are the only thing protecting me from getting here **again**. What will be my actions moving forward? What will be my patterns moving forward? What will I do today, moving forward? You HAVE to think deeply about this. Reading this blog once is not enough. Reread the last 3 paragraphs 3 more times. Pause deeply after each reading and write down on paper the answers to those questions.  

**Actually do it.**

## What has helped me in the past
Often times, there are small, but crucially important things that I do to stay ***balanced***, and whenever I don't do these things, I find myself feeling low. Ask myself: Am I doing these things, now?

* 4-5 days of exercise per week
* Cardio, weightlifting
* Eating healthy
* Eating vitamins (multi-vitamin, vitamin D)
* Talking to people and friends on a regular basis
* Meditating and Prayer

These things, although simple, have proven, time and time again to restore my balance. Don't ignore their absence and remember how they have helped you in the past.

## Where am (was) I at the time of this writing
At the time of this writing, 2am, Wednesday, the 30th of May, the 14th of Ramadan in the summer of 2018, I sit patiently and eagerly in limbo as I have completed most of my interviews for my first job out of college. It has been 1.5 weeks now since I have graduated from UMD. I feel relaxed yet eager for what comes ahead and I am grateful for where I am in life right now. In the next 2-7 days, I will receive news of where my career will take me next and wanted to write this note for myself for some months now. I feel now was an appropriate time. 

**For the people/person still reading**  
For the handful of people who may stumble upon this while getting/wanting to get to know me, thank you for reading this.  If you are one of the handful of people, we may be friends now, or may become friends soon. Don't hesitate to get to know me in person, or by other means. This reflection/piece is rare and a first for me to openly write about. It is something I want to become more comfortable writing about and I hope this experience lets me do more of that. Kudos to you for sticking it out this long   


***This piece had light, to no edits. Just a brain dump of my thoughts when I wrote it,***
